    "## Linear Algebra Review\n",
    "\n",
    "To perform a deep analysis of equality constrained optimization, we recall the following definitions from linear algebra:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The **span** of a collection of vectors $\\{{\\bf v}^{(i)}\\}_{i=1}^N\\subset\\mathbb{R}^d$ is the set of **linear combinations** of the ${\\bf v}^{(i)}$'s:\n",
    "$$\n",

    "$$\n",
    "2. A collection of vectors $\\{{\\bf v}^{(i)}\\}_{i=1}^N\\subset\\mathbb{R}^d$ is called **linearly independent** if $\\sum_{i=1}^n c_i {\\bf v}^{(i)}=0$ if and only if ${\\bf c}={\\bf 0}\\in\\mathbb{R}^N$.\n",
    "3. A collection of vectors $\\{{\\bf v}^{(i)}\\}_{i=1}^N\\subset\\mathbb{R}^d$ is called a **basis** for $\\mathbb{R}^d$ if $\\text{span}(\\{{\\bf v}^{(i)}\\}_{i=1}^N)=\\mathbb{R}^d$ (in this case, we say that the ${\\bf v}^{(i)}$'s span $\\mathbb{R}^d$) and $\\{{\\bf v}^{(i)}\\}_{i=1}^N$ are a linearly independent collection. Note that if $\\{{\\bf v}^{(i)}\\}_{i=1}^N$ is a basis for $\\mathbb{R}^d$, it necessarily follows that $N=d$.\n",
    "4. A collection of vectors $\\{{\\bf u}^{(i)}\\}_{i=1}^d\\subset\\mathbb{R}^d$ is an **orthonormal basis** for $\\mathbb{R}^d$ if $\\Vert {\\bf u}^{(i)}\\Vert=1$ for all $i=1, 2,\\ldots, d$ and $({\\bf u}^{(i)})^T{\\bf u}^{(j)}=0$ for all $i\\not=j$. An orthonormal basis is necessarily a basis.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the standard orthonormal basis, $\\{{\\bf e}^{(i)}\\}_{i=1}^d\\subset\\mathbb{R}^d$ is an orthonormal basis for $\\mathbb{R}^d$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that a **subspace** $\\mathcal{V}$ of $\\mathbb{R}^d$ is a set which is closed under scalar multiplication and vector addition. That is, if $a\\in\\mathbb{R}$, ${\\bf x},{\\bf y}\\in\\mathcal{V}$, then $a\\cdot{\\bf x}, {\\bf x}+{\\bf y}\\in\\mathcal{V}$. Note that $\\text{span}(\\{{\\bf v}^{(i)}\\}_{i=1}^N)$ is always a subspace of $\\mathbb{R}^d$ if $\\{{\\bf v}^{(i)}\\}_{i=1}^N\\subset\\mathbb{R}^d$. For any matrix $A\\in M_{m,n}$, the **kernel** or **null space** of $A$ is the set $\\text{ker}(A)=\\{{\\bf x}\\in\\mathbb{R}^n:A{\\bf x}={\\bf 0}\\}$. It is easy to show that $\\text{ker}(A)$ is always a subspace of $\\mathbb{R}^n$.\n",
    "\n",
    "As above, a basis for $\\mathcal{V}$ is a linearly indpendent collection which spans $\\mathcal{V}$. The **dimension** of $\\mathcal{V}$, $\\text{dim}(\\mathcal{V})$, is the number of elements in any basis of $\\mathcal{V}$. For example, if $\\{{\\bf e}^{(i)}\\}_{i=1}^d\\subset\\mathbb{R}^3$, then $\\mathcal{V}=\\text{span}(\\{{\\bf e}^{(1)},{\\bf e}^{(2)}\\})$ has $\\text{dim}(\\mathcal{V})=2$.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also need to recall the notion of the **rank** of a matrix $A\\in\\mathcal{M}_{m,n}$. The rank of the matrix $A$, $\\text{rank}(A)$ is any one of the following equivalent quantities:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The number of pivot columns in the (reduced) row echelon form of $A$\n",
    "2. The largest number of column vectors of $A$ which forms a linearly independent set\n",
    "3. The largest number of row vectors of $A$ which forms a linearly independent set\n",
    "4. The dimension of the **row space**, $\\text{span}(\\{{\\bf r}^{(i)}\\}_{i=1}^m)$ where $A=\\begin{pmatrix} {\\bf r}^{(1)}\\\\\\vdots\\\\ {\\bf r}^{(m)}\\end{pmatrix}$.\n",
    "5. The dimension of the **column space**, $\\text{span}(\\{{\\bf c}^{(i)}\\}_{i=1}^n)$ where $A=\\begin{pmatrix} {\\bf c}^{(1)}& \\cdots & {\\bf c}^{(m)}\\end{pmatrix}$.\n",
    "6. $m - \\text{dim}(\\text{ker}(A^T))$ (the Rank-Nullity theorem)\n",
    "7. $n - \\text{dim}(\\text{ker}(A))$\n",
    "\n",
    "A matrix $A\\in M_{m,n}$ is said to be **full rank** if $\\text{rank}(A)=\\min(m,n)$. A useful way to characterize full rank matrices is in terms of the linear transformation $f_A:\\mathbb{R}^n\\rightarrow\\mathbb{R}^m$. To state this characterization, recall that a function $f:\\mathbb{R}^n\\rightarrow\\mathbb{R}^m$ is said to be **surjective** or **onto** if for every ${\\bf z}\\in\\mathbb{R}^m$ there is a ${\\bf x}\\in\\mathbb{R}^n$ such that $f({\\bf x})={\\bf z}$, and the function is **injective** or **one-to-one** if $f({\\bf x})=f({\\bf y})$ implies ${\\bf x}={\\bf y}$ for all ${\\bf x}, {\\bf y}\\in\\mathbb{R}^n$. \n",
